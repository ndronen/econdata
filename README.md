## Corruption and GDP growth

Several studies have shown that the perceived level of corruption -- the Perceived Corruption Index (PCI) -- in a country is correlated with long-run GDP growth. [I reproduce this result](https://github.com/ndronen/econdata/blob/main/notebooks/Corruption_and_GDP_growth.ipynb) using corruption data from Transparency International and GDP data from the World Bank. I show visually that at today's level of corruption (2021 PCI), GDP growth from 1975 to 2021 has a strong, non-linear negative correlation with corruption. Less corrupt countries have grown substantially more in those 46 years.
